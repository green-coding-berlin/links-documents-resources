- Tool: https://en-roads.climateinteractive.org/scenario.html?v=22.1.0
- Tool developed by Climate Interactive in Coop with MIT 

- Mainly build as a showcase and education tool to simulate climate policies

- Has been used in the US to educate decision makers like Senators and Gouvenours

- Basic display is Energy Sources and GHG Emissions and Temperature Rise

- You can see many graphs and levers. But before every model it makes sense to dive into the "assumptions". Many I don't know myself. But vast options.
	- First show the "Related Examples". This is the absolute basic knowledge, that there is a problem and where it is coming from. Although to most this is known, it serves as a good overview. 
		- It does not go into any detail however. For this, the advanced mode is available
	
	- Most important are the main options. Like creating a new energy source, of making strict policies.
	
	- But you can also dive in hard, to see how much methane cows are actually producing, or if this is just a fluke
	
	- As you can see the model is what I call semi-pessimistic. It does not generate the solutions right away. For many 10 years is a minimum target.



- Shall we do more on topics like these? Or are you interested more in techy topics that focus on specific solutions, than on theoretical global models?
- One option could be to talk about topics regarding carbon sequestration. Or go more into detail why Methane is so problematic and what is currently done about it.
